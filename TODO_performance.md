- [ ] Implement dynamic icon loading where possible
- [ ] Reduce bundle size by selective imports

## Phase 3: Lazy Loading & Code Splitting

- [ ] Add Suspense boundaries for better UX
- [ ] Optimize component loading strategy

## Phase 4: Callback & Function Optimization
- [ ] Add debouncing to search inputs
- [ ] Memoize event handlers with useCallback
- [ ] Prevent unnecessary re-renders from inline functions

## Phase 5: Animation & Rendering Optimization
- [ ] Optimize framer-motion animations
- [ ] Reduce animation complexity where possible
- [ ] Implement virtual scrolling for large lists if needed

## Phase 6: Data Structure Optimization
- [ ] Move large data structures outside components
- [ ] Implement proper data normalization
- [ ] Optimize data fetching and caching strategies
